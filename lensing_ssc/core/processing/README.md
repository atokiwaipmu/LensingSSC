# Processing

This directory is responsible for the data processing pipelines and steps within the `lensing_ssc` package. It orchestrates the execution of various analysis tasks.

It contains subdirectories for:

-   **managers**: For managing different aspects of the processing workflow (e.g., cache, logs).
-   **pipeline**: For defining and executing sequences of processing steps.
-   **steps**: For individual, modular processing operations.
