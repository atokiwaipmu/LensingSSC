This directory contains modules for defining and executing data processing pipelines. A pipeline consists of a sequence of steps that are applied to the input data to produce the desired output.

Key components include:

-   **Base**: Base classes and utilities for pipeline construction.
-   **Base Pipeline**: Core implementation of a processing pipeline.
-   **Preprocessing**: Specific pipeline implementations for data preprocessing tasks.
